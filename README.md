Enhancing AI Learning with Self-Explanation																																																						
OpenAi's GPT4 as coding assistant		Lately, Large Language Models have been widely used in code generation. GPT4 is considered the most potent Large Language Model from Openai. In this paper, we examine GPT3.5 and GPT4 as coding assistants. More specifically, we have constructed appropriate tests to check whether the two systems can a) answer typical questions that can arise during the code development, b) produce reliable code, and c) contribute to code debugging. The test results are impressive. The performance of GPT4 is outstanding and signals an increase in the productivity of programmers and the reorganization of software development procedures based on these new tools.

LMDX: Language Model-based Document Information Extraction and Localization		Large Language Models (LLM) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), improving state-of-the-art on many existing tasks and exhibiting emergent capabilities. However, LLMs have not yet been successfully applied on semi-structured document information extraction, which is at the core of many document processing workflows and consists of extracting key entities from a visually rich document (VRD) given a predefined target schema. The main obstacles to LLM adoption in that task have been the absence of layout encoding within LLMs, critical for a high quality extraction, and the lack of a grounding mechanism ensuring the answer is not hallucinated. In this paper, we introduce Language Model-based Document Information Extraction and Localization (LMDX), a methodology to adapt arbitrary LLMs for document information extraction. LMDX can do extraction of singular, repeated, and hierarchical entities, both with and without training data, while providing grounding guarantees and localizing the entities within the document. In particular, we apply LMDX to the PaLM 2-S LLM and evaluate it on VRDU and CORD benchmarks, setting a new state-of-the-art and showing how LMDX enables the creation of high quality, data-efficient parsers.

Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP): Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation		"Several recent advances in AI systems (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts and Program-Aided Language Models) solve problems by providing a ""scaffolding"" program that structures multiple calls to language models to generate better outputs. A scaffolding program is written in a programming language such as Python. In this work, we use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed ""improver"" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying a language model several times and returning the best solution. We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. Afterward, we analyze the variety of self-improvement strategies proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in our proof-of-concept experiments, is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We critically consider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox."																																																				
SCREWS: A Modular Framework for Reasoning with Revisions		Large language models (LLMs) can improve their accuracy on various tasks through iteratively refining and revising their output based on feedback. We observe that these revisions can introduce errors, in which case it is better to roll back to a previous result. Further, revisions are typically homogeneous: they use the same reasoning method that produced the initial answer, which may not correct errors. To enable exploration in this space, we present SCREWS, a modular framework for reasoning with revisions. It is comprised of three main modules: Sampling, Conditional Resampling, and Selection, each consisting of sub-modules that can be hand-selected per task. We show that SCREWS not only unifies several previous approaches under a common framework, but also reveals several novel strategies for identifying improved reasoning chains. We evaluate our framework with state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT and GPT-4) on a diverse set of reasoning tasks and uncover useful new reasoning strategies for each: arithmetic word problems, multi-hop question answering, and code debugging. Heterogeneous revision strategies prove to be important, as does selection between original and revised candidates.

CAT-LM: Training Language Models on Aligned Code And Tests		Testing is an integral part of the software development process. Yet, writing tests is time-consuming and therefore often neglected. Classical test generation tools such as EvoSuite generate behavioral test suites by optimizing for coverage, but tend to produce tests that are hard to understand. Language models trained on code can generate code that is highly similar to that written by humans, but current models are trained to generate each file separately, as is standard practice in natural language processing, and thus fail to consider the code-under-test context when producing a test file. In this work, we propose the Aligned Code And Tests Language Model (CAT-LM), a GPT-style language model with 2.7 Billion parameters, trained on a corpus of Python and Java projects. We utilize a novel pretraining signal that explicitly considers the mapping between code and test files when available. We also drastically increase the maximum sequence length of inputs to 8,192 tokens, 4x more than typical code generation models, to ensure that the code context is available to the model when generating test code. We analyze its usefulness for realistic applications, showing that sampling with filtering (e.g., by compilability, coverage) allows it to efficiently produce tests that achieve coverage similar to ones written by developers while resembling their writing style. By utilizing the code context, CAT-LM generates more valid tests than even much larger language models trained with more data (CodeGen 16B and StarCoder) and substantially outperforms a recent test-specific model (TeCo) at test completion. Overall, our work highlights the importance of incorporating software-specific insights when training language models for code and paves the way to more powerful automated test generation.

Large Language Models as Optimizers		Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

[PDF] SceneFormer: Indoor Scene Generation with Transformers | Semantic Scholar		This work generates a sequence of objects, along with their locations and orientations conditioned on a room layout, using only the cross-attention mechanism of transformers, and shows that this model design leads to faster scene generation with similar or improved levels of realism compared to previous methods. We address the task of indoor scene generation by generating a sequence of objects, along with their locations and orientations conditioned on a room layout. Large-scale indoor scene datasets allow us to extract patterns from user-designed indoor scenes, and generate new scenes based on these patterns. Existing methods rely on the 2D or 3D appearance of these scenes in addition to object positions, and make assumptions about the possible relations between objects. In contrast, we do not use any appearance information, and implicitly learn object relations using the self-attention mechanism of transformers. We show that our model design leads to faster scene generation with similar or improved levels of realism compared to previous methods. Our method is also flexible, as it can be conditioned not only on the room layout but also on text descriptions of the room, using only the cross-attention mechanism of transformers. Our user study shows that our generated scenes are preferred to the state-of-the-art FastSynth scenes 53.9% and 56.7% of the time for bedroom and living room scenes, respectively. At the same time, we generate a scene in 1.48 seconds on average, 20% faster than FastSynth.

3D Building Fa√ßade Reconstruction Using Deep Learning		In recent years, advances in computer hardware, graphics rendering algorithms and computer vision have enabled the utilization of 3D building reconstructions in the fields of archeological structure restoration and urban planning. This paper deals with the reconstruction of realistic 3D models of buildings fa√ßades, in the urban environment for cultural heritage. The proposed approach is an extension of our previous work in this research topic, which introduced a methodology for accurate 3D realistic fa√ßade reconstruction by defining and exploiting a relation between stereoscopic image and tacheometry data. In this work, we re-purpose well known deep neural network architectures in the fields of image segmentation and single image depth prediction, for the tasks of fa√ßade structural element detection, depth point-cloud generation and protrusion estimation, with the goal of alleviating drawbacks in our previous design, resulting in a more light-weight, robust, flexible and cost-effective design.

Critical Points Extraction from Building Fa√ßades by Analyzing Gradient Structure Tensor		This paper proposes a building fa√ßade contouring method from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) scans and photogrammetric point clouds. To this end, we calculate the confidence property at multiple scales for an individual point cloud to measure the point cloud‚Äôs quality. The confidence property is utilized in the definition of the gradient for each point. We encode the individual point gradient structure tensor, whose eigenvalues reflect the gradient variations in the local neighborhood areas. The critical point clouds representing the building fa√ßade and rooftop (if, of course, such rooftops exist) contours are then extracted by jointly analyzing dual-thresholds of the gradient and gradient structure tensor. Based on the requirements of compact representation, the initial obtained critical points are finally downsampled, thereby achieving a tradeoff between the accurate geometry and abstract representation at a reasonable level. Various experiments using representative buildings in Semantic3D benchmark and other ubiquitous point clouds from ALS DublinCity and Dutch AHN3 datasets, MLS TerraMobilita/iQmulus 3D urban analysis benchmark, UAV-based photogrammetric dataset, and GeoSLAM ZEB-HORIZON scans have shown that the proposed method generates building contours that are accurate, lightweight, and robust to ubiquitous point clouds. Two comparison experiments also prove the superiority of the proposed method in terms of topological correctness, geometric accuracy, and representation compactness.

Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log		Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics. This post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models.																																																				
LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log		Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.

[PDF] A Survey on Large Language Models for Recommendation | Semantic Scholar		This survey presents a taxonomy that categorizes existing LLM-based recommendation systems into two major paradigms, respectively Discriminative LLM for Recommendation (DLLM4Rec) and Generative LLL4Rec (GLLM 4Rec), with the latter being systematically sorted out for the first time. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have recently gained significant attention in the domain of Recommendation Systems (RS). These models, trained on massive amounts of data using self-supervised learning, have demonstrated remarkable success in learning universal representations and have the potential to enhance various aspects of recommendation systems by some effective transfer techniques such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning, and so on. The crucial aspect of harnessing the power of language models in enhancing recommendation quality is the utilization of their high-quality representations of textual features and their extensive coverage of external knowledge to establish correlations between items and users. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing LLM-based recommendation systems, this survey presents a taxonomy that categorizes these models into two major paradigms, respectively Discriminative LLM for Recommendation (DLLM4Rec) and Generative LLM for Recommendation (GLLM4Rec), with the latter being systematically sorted out for the first time. Furthermore, we systematically review and analyze existing LLM-based recommendation systems within each paradigm, providing insights into their methodologies, techniques, and performance. Additionally, we identify key challenges and several valuable findings to provide researchers and practitioners with inspiration. We have also created a GitHub repository to index relevant papers on LLMs for recommendation, https://github.com/WLiK/LLM4Rec.

This paper provides two contributions to research on using LLMs for software engineering. First, it provides a catalog of patterns for software engineering that classifies patterns according to the types of problems they solve. Second, it explores several prompt patterns that have been applied to improve requirements elicitation, rapid prototyping, code quality, refactoring, and system design.

[PDF] Self-Edit: Fault-Aware Code Editor for Code Generation | Semantic Scholar		This work proposes a generate-and-edit approach named Self-Edit that utilizes execution results of the generated code from LLMs to improve the code quality on the competitive programming task and demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to generate codes on competitive programming tasks. However, with limited sample numbers, LLMs still suffer from poor accuracy. Inspired by the process of human programming, we propose a generate-and-edit approach named Self-Edit that utilizes execution results of the generated code from LLMs to improve the code quality on the competitive programming task. We execute the generated code on the example test case provided in the question and wrap execution results into a supplementary comment. Utilizing this comment as guidance, our fault-aware code editor is employed to correct errors in the generated code.We perform extensive evaluations across two competitive programming datasets with nine different LLMs. Compared to directly generating from LLMs, our approach can improve the average of pass@1 by 89% on APPS-dev, 31% on APPS-test, and 48% on HumanEval over nine popular code generation LLMs with parameter sizes ranging from 110M to 175B. Compared to other post-processing methods, our method demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency.																																																				
[PDF] Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review | Semantic Scholar		A systematic literature review on LLM4SE is conducted, with a particular focus on understanding how LLMs can be exploited to optimize processes and outcomes. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted numerous domains, including Software Engineering (SE). Many recent publications have explored LLMs applied to various SE tasks. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the application, effects, and possible limitations of LLMs on SE is still in its early stages. To bridge this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review on LLM4SE, with a particular focus on understanding how LLMs can be exploited to optimize processes and outcomes. We collect and analyze 229 research papers from 2017 to 2023 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In RQ1, we categorize different LLMs that have been employed in SE tasks, characterizing their distinctive features and uses. In RQ2, we analyze the methods used in data collection, preprocessing, and application highlighting the role of well-curated datasets for successful LLM for SE implementation. RQ3 investigates the strategies employed to optimize and evaluate the performance of LLMs in SE. Finally, RQ4 examines the specific SE tasks where LLMs have shown success to date, illustrating their practical contributions to the field. From the answers to these RQs, we discuss the current state-of-the-art and trends, identifying gaps in existing research, and flagging promising areas for future study.

[PDF] Recommender Systems in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs) | Semantic Scholar		A comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompting, which comprehensively discusses future directions in this emerging field. With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become an important component of our daily life, providing personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating textual side information, DNN-based methods still face limitations, such as difficulties in understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information, inabilities in generalizing to various recommendation scenarios and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent studies have attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems, to provide researchers in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompting. More specifically, we first introduce representative methods to harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations of users and items. Then, we review recent techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss future directions in this emerging field.
